Exercise

# Q1. Refactoring

Now we need to create the "main" block from which we'll invoke the main function. How does the if statement that we use for this looks like?

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
```

# Q2. Installing Pytest

Next, create a folder tests and create two files. One will be the file with tests. We can name if test_batch.py.

What should be the other file?

- `__init__.py`

# Q3. Writing first unit tests
How many rows should be there in the expected dataframe?

- [ ] 1
- [ ] 2
- [X] 3
- [ ] 4

# Q4. Mocking S3 with Localstack

Adjust it for localstack. How does the command look like?

```bash
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 s3 mb s3://nyc-duration
```

# Q5. Creating test data
What's the size of the file?

- [ ] 3512
- [X] 33512
- [ ] 63512
- [ ] 93512


# Q6. Finish the integration test

What's the sum of predicted durations for the test dataframe?
```
69.29
```
